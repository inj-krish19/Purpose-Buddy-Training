Q:  Create simple PHP scripts with controller-like structures.
Ans : So API that follows the principles of REST.
REST is an architectural style for designing networked 
applications. API 's full form is Application Programming Interface.
Here we will now about REST API that is relying on stateless, 
client-server communication, and the use of standard HTTP methods
like GET , PUT , POST , DELETE , etc ...

There are mainly two types of API :
1 ) REST API
2 ) RESTful API

The main difference between both is 

RESTful API uses appropriate HTTP methods for different operation 
where REST API mainly uses POST method for almost all operation.

Also RESTful is more stateless in nature of REST and resource focused.

Ex. of REST API : 

i ) Twitter API : https://developer.x.com/en/docs
ii ) Facebook Graph API : https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api
iii ) Instagram API : https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/instagram-api-with-facebook-login
